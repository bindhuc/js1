<h1>Javascript</h1>
<h4>Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic
     and interactive web content like applications and browsers</h4>
     <hr>
     <h1>Javascript engine</h1>
     <h4> The JavaScript Engine is generally used for interpreting the JavaScript. 
         It is used to interpret the javascript and execute the javscript on the web page.</h4>
         <hr>
         <h1>What is execution in js</h1>
         <h4>
            JavaScript engine executes the code line by line, assigns the values to variables, and executes the function calls
         </h4>
         <hr>
         <h1>Run time environment</h1>
         <h4>
            The JavaScript runtime environment provides access to built-in libraries and 
            objects that are available 
            to a program so that it can interact with the outside world and make the code work

         <h3>browser has following elements:</h3>
         <ul>
 <li> JavaScript engine </li>
<li>Web APIs</li>
<li> callback queue</li>
<li>event loop</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3> heap</h3>
that is used for the allocation of objects and variables
<h3> call stack</h3>
The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of where we are in the program and runs in a last-in, first-out way.
<h3> Web APIs</h3>
Web APIs are not a part of the JavaScript engine, 
but they are part of the runtime environment provided by the browser 
<h3> callback queue</h3>  
The callback queue stores the callback functions sent from the Web APIs in the order in which they were added.
<h3>event loop</h3> 
The job of the event loop is to constantly monitor the state of the call stack and the callback queue  

<h3>Working</h3>
<ul>
<li> The runtime environment is what makes JavaScript code work, and in a browser in consists of the JS engine,
 a lot of Web APIs, a callback queue and the event loop</li>
<li> The JS engine translates source code into machine code that allows a computer
 to perform specific tasks at the hardware level</li>
<li> Web APIs extend the JS language and push callback functions to the callback queue once actions 
are complete and data has been received</li>
<li> The callback queue stores callback functions in order, ready to be executed</li>
<li> The event loop is constantly monitoring the call stack and the callback queue;
 if the call stack is empty it will move the callback function at the front of the queue 
 to the call stack, scheduling it for execution</li>

</ul>
